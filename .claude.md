# Claude Project Context - LeetCode Practice

## Project Overview
This is a daily coding practice repository focused on solving one problem per day from LeetCode, HackerRank, and other coding challenge platforms. The goal is to build consistency and improve problem-solving skills.

```

## File Naming Convention
- Format: `XXX_problem_name.py` or `XXX_problem_name.ts` (e.g., `001_diagonal_difference.py`, `015_merge_sorted_array.ts`)
- Use sequential numbering with zero-padding (001, 002, 003, etc.)
- Use snake_case for problem names
- Place in appropriate difficulty folder (easy/medium/hard)
- Supports both Python (.py) and TypeScript (.ts) implementations

## Code Style & Requirements

### Problem Solution Template
Every solution file should include:
1. **Header docstring/comment** with:
   - Problem name
   - Source (LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.) with URL if available
   - Difficulty level
   - Date solved
   - Problem description
   - Examples
   - Constraints

2. **Solution class** with methods that include:
   - Clear method names
   - Docstrings/JSDoc comments with Time and Space complexity analysis
   - Clean, readable code

3. **Test cases** in the test block:
   - Python: `if __name__ == "__main__"` block
   - TypeScript: `runTests()` function at the end
   - Include multiple test cases
   - Use assertions to verify correctness
   - Print confirmation when all tests pass

### Code Quality
- Write clean, readable code (Python or TypeScript)
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments only where logic is non-obvious
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Always document time and space complexity

## Workflow for New Problems

1. **Create solution file** using the template.py structure
2. **Implement solution** with test cases
3. **Verify tests pass** before considering it complete
4. **Update README.md**:
   - Increment total problems solved count
   - Add entry to Problems Log table with date, problem name, difficulty, source, and brief notes
   - Update difficulty breakdown (Easy/Medium/Hard counts)
5. **Update TODO.md** if tracking specific problem queues or topics

## Testing
- Always include test cases in solution files
- Test edge cases and constraints
- Run tests before committing:
  - Python: `python easy/XXX_problem_name.py`
  - TypeScript: `bun easy/XXX_problem_name.ts`

## Git Commit Style
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Format: `Add [Problem Name] problem for day N` or `Fix bug in [Problem Name] solution`
- Keep commits focused on single problems or fixes
- **DO NOT** include "Co-Authored-By: Claude" or similar attribution in commit messages

## Current Focus
- Currently working through **Easy problems** to build consistency
- Aiming for one problem per day
- Recently added: Grading Students, Two Sum, Valid Parentheses, 8 new Easy problems (stacks, two-pointer, linked lists, binary search, arrays)
- In Progress: Add Two Numbers (Medium)
- Total: 14 problems completed (11 Easy, 1 Medium, 2 In Progress)
- Additional: 7 data engineering/data science problems available for practice
- **New:** Adding TypeScript versions of select problems (Merge Sorted Array, Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock)

## Data Science & Data Engineering Problems

The `datascience/` folder contains 7 practical data manipulation problems common in data engineering interviews:
- Each problem is in its own file (001-007) with self-contained tests
- These problems focus on real-world data tasks (cleaning, aggregation, ETL, pivot tables)
- Can be solved with pure Python or using pandas/numpy
- Great practice for data-heavy roles
- Run individual problems: `python datascience/001_data_cleaning_aggregation.py`
- See `datascience/README.md` for full problem list

## Important Notes
- Don't over-engineer solutions - focus on clarity and correctness first
- Optimize only after getting a working solution
- Document the approach and thought process when solving complex problems
- Keep the template.py file unchanged - it's the blueprint for new solutions
