# Claude Project Context - LeetCode Practice

## Project Overview
This is a daily coding practice repository focused on solving one problem per day from LeetCode, HackerRank, and other coding challenge platforms. The goal is to build consistency and improve problem-solving skills.

## Project Structure
```
.
├── easy/           # Easy difficulty problems
├── medium/         # Medium difficulty problems
├── hard/           # Hard difficulty problems
├── template.py     # Template for new problem solutions
├── README.md       # Progress tracker and problems log
└── TODO.md         # Work tracker and task list
```

## File Naming Convention
- Format: `XXX_problem_name.py` (e.g., `001_diagonal_difference.py`)
- Use sequential numbering with zero-padding (001, 002, 003, etc.)
- Use snake_case for problem names
- Place in appropriate difficulty folder (easy/medium/hard)

## Code Style & Requirements

### Problem Solution Template
Every solution file should include:
1. **Header docstring** with:
   - Problem name
   - Source (LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.) with URL if available
   - Difficulty level
   - Date solved
   - Problem description
   - Examples
   - Constraints

2. **Solution class** with methods that include:
   - Clear method names
   - Docstrings with Time and Space complexity analysis
   - Clean, readable code

3. **Test cases** in the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block:
   - Include multiple test cases
   - Use assertions to verify correctness
   - Print confirmation when all tests pass

### Code Quality
- Write clean, readable Python code
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments only where logic is non-obvious
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Always document time and space complexity

## Workflow for New Problems

1. **Create solution file** using the template.py structure
2. **Implement solution** with test cases
3. **Verify tests pass** before considering it complete
4. **Update README.md**:
   - Increment total problems solved count
   - Add entry to Problems Log table with date, problem name, difficulty, source, and brief notes
   - Update difficulty breakdown (Easy/Medium/Hard counts)
5. **Update TODO.md** if tracking specific problem queues or topics

## Testing
- Always include test cases in solution files
- Test edge cases and constraints
- Run tests before committing: `python easy/XXX_problem_name.py`

## Git Commit Style
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Format: `Add [Problem Name] problem for day N` or `Fix bug in [Problem Name] solution`
- Keep commits focused on single problems or fixes

## Current Focus
- Currently working through **Easy problems** to build consistency
- Aiming for one problem per day

## Important Notes
- Don't over-engineer solutions - focus on clarity and correctness first
- Optimize only after getting a working solution
- Document the approach and thought process when solving complex problems
- Keep the template.py file unchanged - it's the blueprint for new solutions
